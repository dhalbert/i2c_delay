# I2C Delay Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

## Overview

Demonstrates 10ms delay between transactions.

If you have a new I2C application to go (for example, read the temperature data from external sensor with I2C interface), try this as a basic template, then add your own code.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

ESP32-S2; MSA301

#### Pin Assignment:

**Note:** The following pin assignments are used by default, you can change these in the `menuconfig` .

|                  | SDA             | SCL           |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| ESP I2C Master   | I2C_MASTER_SDA | I2C_MASTER_SCL |
| MSA301 Sensor    | SDA            | SCL            |


For the actual default value of `I2C_MASTER_SDA` and `I2C_MASTER_SCL` see `Example Configuration` in `menuconfig`.

**Note: ** There’s no need to add an external pull-up resistors for SDA/SCL pin, because the driver will enable the internal pull-up resistors.

### Build and Flash

Enter `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

```bash
I (328) i2c-delay-example: I2C initialized successfully
I (338) i2c-delay-example: WHO_AM_I = 71
I (338) i2c-delay-example: I2C unitialized successfully
```
